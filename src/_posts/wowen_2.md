# Introducing Wowen: The world’s first modular blockchain built on delegated consensus

**An Overview**

> _Designed to transform blockchain features into services which are easy to access, Wowen empowers Web3 users and developers by giving consensus choice in a single network. Minimising the friction and complexity experienced in monolithic blockchains, Wowen is the world’s first modular blockchain network providing consensus choice to it’s users._
>
> _With the possibility for users to decide which consensus algorithm types they want to use for their transactions, smart contracts and applications, Wowen enables everyone to optimise for speed, cost and finality. Wowen promises to be a pioneer in the_ [_rapidly emerging_](https://cointelegraph.com/news/modular-blockchains-could-be-the-next-hot-crypto-market-trend-in-2023) _modular blockchain landscape._

Through their novel public modular blockchain, Wowen addresses the inherent limitations of traditional blockchain stacks by providing a groundbreaking solution. The innovative modular architecture empowers users through a radically enhanced flexibility and reliability for blockchain transactions, providing dynamic access to multiple public chains’ consensus.

Developed by RunTime Machines (RTM), a software engineering company based in Switzerland, the roadmap has a timeline of Q3 2023 for Beta Testnet, with the Mainnet Launch in Q4 2023.

# Robust critical infrastructure operations with dynamic consensus access

The Wowen Delegated Consensus mechanism separates the Consensus layer from the Data availability layer, providing consensus modularity. Wowen delegates the Consensus layer, empowering users to transact on the blockchain with the consensus mechanism of their choice for each transaction.

In an innovative move, Wowen overcomes the limitations of the monolithic blockchains’ consensus function and introduces a new dimension of flexibility, reliability, cost and speed for blockchain transactions.

One of the unique features is the flexible consensus choice on a ‘per transaction’ basis. Both developers and end users have the ability to select the specific chain from which they want to obtain consensus for their transactions.

This flexibility enables users to choose one of multiple chains (Ethereum, Binance, Avalanche, Polygon and Hedera Hashgraph) according to the requirements of each smart contract use case.

Essentially, through the inclusion of transactions with different consensus mechanisms in the same block, unseen customisation and efficiency can be experienced for the first time.

Wowen’s architecture comprises of four main components:

- **a network of EVM-based Wowen nodes** that execute transactions and update the network state.
- **Wowen Consensus Wrappers** that enable consensus on external blockchains for each transaction.
- **Wowen Manager** that allows setting a preferred external Consensus Provider for an address.
- **Wowen Explorer** that enables viewing and querying the network’s state.

The Wowen public network comprises of a set of nodes that are based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Users can interact with the Wowen Network via Wowen node(s), using Web3- compatible wallets, such as Metamask, or directly through Web3 APIs (such as web3.js or ethers.js and their variants in other languages).

Transactions are executed on the Wowen nodes, where Wowen dApps can be developed using Solidity and Vyper as well as any other EVM compatible language. This approach leverages the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem and provides a seamless experience for developers and users.

# Wowen for endless possibilities

A robust and uninterruptible infrastructure operation, consistent user experience and protection for project revenues are all made possible through Wowen’s autonomous intelligent switching of blockchains consensus.

Wowen also provides companies with the ability to utilise multiple chains simultaneously for consensus, thereby eliminating delays and gas spikes. Trading and DeFi can also benefit from the technology, leveraging the most suitable consensus form, optimising gas prices, speed, and security configuration, all within a single network.

Wowen has the potential to serve and impact such industries as:

- Financial services (stock exchanges, payment systems, banks).
- Government facilities (datacenters, courthouses).
- Energy production and distribution facilities (e.g. power plants).
- Emergency services (e.g. hospitals).
- All companies exploring Web3 marketing technologies.
- Web2 and Web3 Gaming.
- DeFi.
- Web3 communities.
