Once upon a time, on the 1st December 2022 RunTime Machines was born.

I see startups, or some of those, as an example of chaordic organizations. More biological machines, organisms, rather than rigidly organized, classical mechanical systems. As Dee Hock, the founder and CEO of VISA, put it ‚ÄúFormation of a chaordic organization is a difficult, often painful process, but one also filled with joy and humor.‚Äù

In June we had the joy of celebrating our first six months of life. Celebrations come with humble reflections of what we have achieved, what we failed, and how to shape the next steps.

We have understood that, in Web3, DeFi and Blockchain, the era of the protocols is finishing, the era of infrastructure is here. It will be difficult to succeedwith the 1001-th blockchain, the layers and their ecosystem are consolidating towards few ‚Äúdominant‚Äù ones. The infrastructure for those, instead, leaves room for improvements, new ideas, novel and more efficient implementations.

üõ† In six months, we designed, engineered and implemented Wowen Modular Blockhain Alpha and its testnet, the first modular blockchain with delegated consensus (more on that to come). A Blockchain that does not want to be the 1001-th Blockchain. We launched it with the first Modular Hackathon in Zurich, Switzerland, with our partners swissDAO and TRUST SQUARE.

üöÄ In six months, we have built POC and products in the tokenization, advanced distributed identity and arbitrage trading with private clients. We have also consulted on #stablecoins, synthetic money and advanced #gametheory for #blockchain games.

üìö In six months we have learnt that, in the communities in which we operate, #opensource is as important as Patenting or protecting Intellectual Property. With that spirit, we have contributed to cryptographic protocols and smart contracts libraries:

üí° we increased the the landscape of domains in which [Bulletproof](https://github.com/runtime-machines/bulletproofs/tree/u128-and-scalar) can be used allowing u128 inputs,

üí° we introduced slice arguments instead of vector's references in [NOIR](https://github.com/runtime-machines/noir/tree/slice-over-vec),

üí° we implemented the node decoding function for [EthereumTrieDB](https://github.com/polytope-labs/solidity-merkle-trees/pull/22) in the verification of Modified Merkle Patricia proof,

üí° we proposed a solution to fix an issue on the RlpIterator's len function of the [parity-common](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-common/issues/761), a collection of Rust crates used in Parity Technologies projects,

We are learning, we are thinking, we are building. Happy six months birthday RunTime Machines!
